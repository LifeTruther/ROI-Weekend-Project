# ROI-Weekend-Project
This was the third weekend project assigned during bootcamp. It is a rudimentary calculator for projected ROI of a rental property. 
The program asks for several parameters, and allows the user to record expenses and view them in a dictionary. 
Once all requested parameters have been obtained, the program produces a calculated ROI for the property.
